# Comprehensive Analysis of War-Driven Epidemiological Divergence

A primary challenge in crisis epidemiology is not only studying the effects of disruptive events on public health, but also distinguishing true changes in infectious disease transmission from artifacts of surveillance system collapse.

This paper presents a rigorous, data-driven analysis pertaining to these challenges using Ukraine’s Kharkiv region as a critical case study. We employ a decade of detailed monthly incidence data (2015-2924), including the period of active war, to quantify and interpret a profound divergence between different infection types. Using time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for pre-war data to generate expected incidence, we apply parametric P-scores to measure the deviation of observed cases for acute respiratory infections (COVID-19, influenza) and intestinal infections (salmonellosis, rotavirus). The analysis reveals a stark, war-driven epidemiological divergence. First, reported respiratory infections plummeted in areas experiencing active combat. Our models confirm this decline, which inversely correlates with air raid alert intensity, is a function of widespread surveillance collapse and underreporting, not a true reduction in transmission. Second, in stark contrast, intestinal infections exhibited a gradual resurgence across most subregions. This increase, attributed to the deterioration of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and overcrowding, directly correlated with air raid alerts, suggesting reporting persisted due to symptom acuteness. These findings demonstrate the complex, condition-specific impacts of armed conflict. Critically, this study establishes a replicable methodological framework for interpreting unreliable surveillance data, enabling public health organizations to better distinguish surveillance artifacts from genuine epidemiological trends in active conflict zones.
